# Capt Todd Branchflower Bio

Originally from Summit, NJ.  Graduated USAFA in 2007 as CompEngr major - squadrons 23, 19, and 40.  First assignment was the 46th Test Squadron at Eglin AFB, FL.  My first year there, I worked on the AF's next-gen network intrusion prevention and detection acquisitions and intranet modernization.  I was the squadron exec for a year.  Then, I worked on the integration and testing of digital radios on different aircraft.  After that, the AF sent me to Stanford for 1.5 years.  I did research with Tom Kenny's group on MEMS, but also got really interested in computers and startups.

Live in Lone Tree with fiance Liz - wedding date is September 1st.

Other stuff I like:  

 - AF Falcon sports (particularly football, basketball)
 - NY Jets
 - NY Yankees
 - Parks and Rec
 - Taylor Ham (NJ delicacy)
 - Climbing (have climbed Mt Rainier, Grand Teton, Mt Kilimanjaro, Forbidden Peak, Devil's Tower)
 - Linux (run Arch Linux), vim, bash, i3 (Tiling Window Manager),
