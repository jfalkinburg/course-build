# Foreword

Imagine a tool .  Computers are that tool.  

Welcome to the coolest course you've ever taken.

This is a course about computers.  Not the basic building blocks / theory of computers, but practical knowledge we can use to make them do useful work for us.  Here, we're makers.  We're builders.

If I'm successful, you'll leave this course with the knowledge and desire to create incredible things with computers.
